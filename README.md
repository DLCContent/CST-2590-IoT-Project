# CST-2590-IoT-Project
A simple conceptual Disaster UAV with the focus on collecting sensor data, sending the data to a Cloud (ThingSpeak), retrieving the data from the cloud, and display it on the LCD. This project is more focused on the sensor data collection rather than flying, but for demonstration purposes, we have a single DC motor to simulate flight.
